# Abstract
This paper explores the Ethereum protocol, polynomial blind computation protocols, the Pinocchio protocol, and fully homomorphic encryption schemes. A modification of the cryptographic primitive in the modern ZK-SNARK protocol is proposed. The study analyzes the feasibility of using the modified protocol and reveals that the changes reduce the number of operations required to construct the polynomial by approximately 37%. Additionally, the communication data size in the protocol channel is reduced by 5.5â€“11%. It is important to note that further research is needed to evaluate the size of the proof for the correctness of the constructed polynomials. Moreover, the work does not consider the elliptic curve pairings used as a homomorphic cipher in the original protocol.
